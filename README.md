# Fly_Ops: Flight Management System

Fly_Ops is a web application for managing data related to airlines, aircraft, and stations for creating flights.

Built using Java Spring Boot for the backend and React Three Fiber for the 3D component frontend.

Azure Cosmos DB for database operations. 

The airplane model triggers the respective menu item with scroll-wheel movement for interactivity.

Integrates aviation data from [OpenFlights](https://openflights.org/data.php).
